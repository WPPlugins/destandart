Replaces some annoying common german typos in comments 

== Description ==

Replaces "standart" by "standard" and "Euronen", "Teuro", "Teuronen" by Euro. 

Probably the weirdest plugin I ever wrote, but somehow the "Standart"-Typo drives me nuts.

= This plugin = 

The 'correction' is done when rendering the comments, not in the 
database - replacing is hence reversible, by disabling the plugin.
 
== Installation ==

1. Upload the destandart-folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or by upload in the webinterface.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
